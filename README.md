# ART151_WallDrawing

Steps:
1# Divide the canvas into 4 quadrants by drawing 1 horizontal line and 1 vertical line, both going through the center of the canvas. 

** We will consider the 2 lines we just made as 4 separate lines coming from the center of the canvas. 
Line 1 - comes from the center to the top of the canvas
Line 2 - comes from the center to the left of the canvas
Line 3 - comes from the center to the right of the canvas
Line 4 - comes from the center to the bottom of the canvas **

2# Pick one of the lines. Measure it's overall length, divide it by 50, and record this measurement. Starting from the center of the page, proceed to make 50 small marks on the line you picked, that are equally separated (use the previous measurement as the separation distance).

3# Repeat step 2# for the other 3 lines. 

** Now we will begin to draw in each of our 4 quadrants **

** For the following steps we will assume the "1st mark" on the line is the mark you made on the line located the fartest from the center of the page (we could also say it's the one on the border of the canvas). Then the "2nd line" will be the 2nd fartest mark from the center, and so on with the "3rd," "4th, "5th", until you reach the "50th mark."

** We will start with the top left cuadrant **

4# Draw a line that starts at the "1st mark" of Line 1 and ends on the "50th mark" of Line 2. Then draw another line that starts at the "2nd mark" of Line 1 and ends on the "49th mark" of Line 2. Then draw another line that starts at the "3rd mark" of Line 1 and ends on the "48th mark" of Line 2. Continue making lines starting at Line 1 and ending on Line 2 following the same pattern (ex. 4th to 47th, 5th to 46th, 7th to 45th, and so on until you get to 50th to 1st). You will end up with 50 diagonal lines from Line 1 to line 2 with different inclinations forming a nice curved shape. 

** We will continue with the rest of the quadrants ***

5# Similar to what you did on the top left quadrant, we will begin drawing lines on the top right quadrant. Here you will begin by drawing a line that starts at the "1st mark" of Line 1 and ends on the "50th mark" of Line 3. Like in the previous quadrant, continue making lines following the pattern: 2nd to 49th, 3rd to 48th, 4th to 47th, 5th to 46th, 7th to 45th, and so on until you get to 50th to 1st. 

5# Again, like in the top left quadrant, we will begin drawing lines on the bottom right quadrant. Here you will begin by drawing a line that starts at the "1st mark" of Line 4 and ends on the "50th mark" of Line 2. Again, continue making lines following the pattern: 2nd to 49th, 3rd to 48th, 4th to 47th, 5th to 46th, 7th to 45th, and so on until you get to 50th to 1st.

5# Finally, again, like in the top left quadrant, we will begin drawing lines on the bottom left quadrant. Here you will begin by drawing a line that starts at the "1st mark" of Line 4 and ends on the "50th mark" of Line 3. Again, continue making lines following the pattern: 2nd to 49th, 3rd to 48th, 4th to 47th, 5th to 46th, 7th to 45th, and so on until you get to 50th to 1st.

** And you are done!!!! ....hopefully **
